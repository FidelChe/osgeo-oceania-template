<p>It was back in 2011, OpenStreetMap was introduced in Bangladesh. A working group was formed led by a group of students from Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology (BUET) to kick-start the platform. Later in the year of 2013, The World Bank, Bangladesh (GFDRR, WSP), revived the initiative. However, it was from 2015 the community found the spark it was thriving for! In January 2015, the OSMBD community started to collaborate with HOT &amp; Missing Maps project. That was the moment from when the community started making the vibe. In last three eventful years, the community collaborated with different Agencies &amp; organizations in their projects promoting &amp; integrating OpenStreetMap Platform. With the aim of bringing all the awesome works done in various sectors under the same wing, different enthusiastic and expert individuals from a variety of backgrounds joined together to form teams &amp; organizational platforms like Bangladesh Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Operations Team (BHOOT), Bangladesh Open Innovation Lab (BOIL) &amp; OpenStreetMap Bangladesh Foundation (OSMBDF).
The core approach relies on solving real world problems through the proper utilization of open data on the OpenStreetMap platform, while building partnership with like-minded organizations and communities all over the world at the same time. 
A diversified community, individual expertise in various relevant areas, blended with technological approach and multi directional relationships with different organizations both home and abroad is the base of our strong presence in the arena. A continuously evolving, vibrant community, comprised of passionate people aiming towards the establishment of a sustainable open data ecosystem making the initiatives stronger day by day.</p>
<p>The presentation will tell the awesome story of the evolution of the community focusing on all the past/current works &amp; future plans on moving forward.</p>
