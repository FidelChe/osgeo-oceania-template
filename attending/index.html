        <p>
            Running a conference is a lot of hard work, but also a lot of fun and very rewarding. Though the local team have many aspects of the conference covered, we are always looking for eager people who can volunteer to help out with some tasks during the conference. So if you want to add that little extra to the conference and can volunteer just a little of your time, head on over to the SotM 2019 <a href="https://engelsystem.heigit.org" target="_blank">Volunteer system</a>!
        </p>

            This year we are using the <a href="https://engelsystem.heigit.org" target="_blank">Engelsystem</a> tool as a means of managing volunteers. On there, once you have registered you can assign yourself to shifts throughout the conference. Things that we need help with include helping at the registration desk, refilling the drink tables during breaks, and working the cameras that are used for live streaming talks.
