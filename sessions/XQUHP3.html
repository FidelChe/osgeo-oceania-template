<h2>OpenStreetMap intrinsic quality assessment using “Is OSM up-to-date?” web application</h2>
<p><em>Marco Minghini and Francesco Frassinelli</em>
<p>Approaches to analyze OpenStreetMap (OSM) intrinsically, i.e. based on the history of data, have become an established way to achieve a wide range of final goals, most importantly to study its quality. Started in 2017, “Is OSM up-to-date?” is an open source web application licensed under AGPL and mainly written in Python. It can be also run in the command line or inside a Docker container. The target beneficiaries of the software are OSM users and communities, who need to assess the quality of data in a given area to decide whether to use it or not as well as where mapping efforts should be best directed, and OSM researchers and scholars, who can use it as a tool to help in their OSM quality studies. The project has a dedicated wiki page (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Is_OSM_up-to-date), source code is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate) and a demo is available at https://is-osm-uptodate.frafra.eu. Using the OSM API, the web application generates history-based, quality-oriented visualizations of OSM nodes and ways having at least one tag for any rectangular user-selected region. Such visualizations (on top of a grayscale OSM basemap) are available for the following criteria: date of creation, date of last edit, number of versions, number of different contributors who edited that node or way, and frequency of update. When an OSM node or way is clicked, a popup shows its values for the previously mentioned criteria as well as the list of currently available tags and the links to the OSM iD editor (in edit mode on that node or way), history and details of that node or way (both linked to the OSM website). A number of additional features to further improve the analysis of quality is currently planned (see https://github.com/frafra/is-osm-uptodate/labels/enhancement).</p></p>
