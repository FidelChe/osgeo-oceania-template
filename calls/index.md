In September the OpenStreetMap community will come together for our annual State of the Map conference. It is set to be an exciting three day event where mappers, programmers, practitioners, entrepreneurs, and policy makers will share their passion for OpenStreetMap.

You can be a part of this event by proposing a talk to either the main conference tracks or the academic part of the conference. You are encouraged to submit proposals for talks, academic talks, lightning talks, and workshops of any topic related to the world of OpenStreetMap. If you require a grant or scholarship to attend, don't hassle to apply for a scholarship!

The deadline to submit your session proposals is April 24. The deadline to apply for a scholarship is March 30.
