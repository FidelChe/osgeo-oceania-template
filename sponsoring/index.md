## COVID-19

Originally, the State of the Map 2020 was planned to be an in-person conference hosted in Cape Town, South Africa. Because of the Coronavirus disease Pandemic it was necessary to [switch](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2020/03/27/sotm-2020-will-be-a-virtual-conference/) to an online conference format. This change is also reflected in what we can offer in the various sponsorship packages above. You can still find the original sponsorship prospectus [here]({{site.baseurl}}/sponsoring-sotm2020.pdf).
