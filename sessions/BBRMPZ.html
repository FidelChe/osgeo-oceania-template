<h2>Deriviste - Click and Go Photo Mapping</h2>
<p><em>Christopher Beddow</em>
<p>There are many OSM editing tools, but only one that allows the user to click inside a Mapillary image to add new data to the map. Richard Fairhurst's Deriviste tool was a quick experiment that proved this was possible, but it's important to ask more questions. How useful is the tool? How accurate and precise is it? How can it be improved?</p></p>
