## Submit your poster to SotM!

At State of the Map we love hearing what has been done with open map data, but we also love seeing it too. Therefore, we welcome you to participate in our poster exhibition at State of the Map 2019 in Heidelberg!

Your poster could show how well your home region is mapped, it could be a beautiful new style or map. It might focus on a community project or statistics, it might be a poster explaining and inviting people to OpenStreetMap. What's important, is we want it to be about OSM. We're also welcoming academic posters about research around OpenStreetMap data.

The posters will be displayed during the conference's poster session on Sunday evening, where there will be the opportunity to present and discuss the posters over some food and drinks.

## Rules for the exhibition

* Poster should be for A0 size (841×1189mm)
* Poster should be related to OpenStreetMap
* Max. 2 entries per person

## How to enter

* Upload your poster online
* Send an e-mail to sotm@openstreetmap.org with the subject “Poster Entry“
* Include: a link to the image, title of the poster, your name(s), whether you would like to bring the A0 poster or inquire us to print it. The license of the submitted works is considered to be CC BY-SA 4.0, unless noted otherwise on the image.

## Deadline: 18th August 2019

The SotM team hopes to shortlist up to 20 posters that will be displayed during the State of the Map 2019 conference in Heidelberg.

You don’t have to attend SotM 2019 to submit a poster, but great conversations happen while viewing the posters so grab your SotM ticket now!
