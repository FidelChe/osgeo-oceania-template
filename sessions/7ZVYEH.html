<p>The OpenStreetMap (OSM) community is a global community crossing cultures, languages, and geographical boundaries. Researchers have been working to develop automated approaches to understanding the composition of this community through their contributions to the OSM database. In this talk we propose a new and novel application of theories and models of species abundance from ecological science to understand contributor community structure and distributions in OSM.</p>
