<h2>Using OpenStreetMap Building Footprints Data for Population Distribution Model: A Case Study in Cavite, Philippines</h2>
<p><em>Dinnah Feye H. Andal</em>
<p>Spatially accurate population distribution maps are essential for disaster risk assessment. Philippines has undergone rapid urbanization and population growth but existing spatial population distribution data across the country is still lacking, thus the dependence for exposure data on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is high. In this study, we explored the use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, with the census data of Cavite, Philippines in 2015 from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), in generating population distribution maps for Cavite. The results showed that OSM database can be used to produce population distribution model using GIS. However, using OSM data might have some limitations as completeness and positional accuracy of the data can vary across different study areas. Previous studies have found that the completeness of data in populated or urban areas are better compared to rural areas. The model can be best used when the quality of OSM data such as its completeness, consistency, accuracy, validity, and timeliness is high.</p></p>
<h2>Public Transport in OSM</h2>
<p><em>Porfirio Carrasco</em>
<p>In 2014 the OSM Nicaragua community started mapping Public Transport, now we are working on increasing the coverage of it mapping other cities, on this brief talk you will learn how the local
community is managing the whole project to achieve the goals and how to get easily started on Mapping the Public Transport in your city.</p></p>
<h2>Rendering order in openstreetmap-carto</h2>
<p><em>Matthijs Melissen</em>
<p>Why are tunnels under squares invisible? Why do tunnels hide buildings? Why is the Eiffel Tower invisible? Questions like these we often receive as maintainers of  openstreetmap-carto, the default
stylesheet on openstreetmap.org <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">http://openstreetmap.org</a>. Rendering order turns out to be a quite complex topic. In this short talk, I will give a brief overview of the rationale behind some of the rendering order decisions in openstreetmap-carto.</p></p>
