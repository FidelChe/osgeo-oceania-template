<p>Serving maps is one of the most common uses of OpenStreetMap data. This talk goes over the component-level architecture for common and uncommon ways to serve maps</p>
<p>Maps are served by many people in many ways. This talk covers the basics you need to know to understand the components when setting up your own maps. All common architectures are covered, including the Standard (OpenStreetMap Carto) layer on OpenStreetMap.org, hosted by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. Both open source and some proprietary architectures are covered.</p>
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of each architecture are considered. Itâ€™s important to match an architecture to your needs, and this talk helps you do that, considering performance, complexity, design and other requirements.</p>
<p>The presenter has several years of experience running and consulting on tile servers and other map services, varying from standard deployments to unique one-off situations, and the questions answered in this talk are the ones typically asked by people working through their first setup. Even if you already have tile server running, this presentation will be useful in helping you understand it better, maintain it more easily, and possible architectural improvements.</p>
<p>A basic knowledge of Linux, web serving, software architecture, and cloud architecture is useful but not required for this presentation.</p>
